/*
get a random number less than 10,
then, wait three seconds
then, write the number to the hard drive
Then, once all that is done, console log "I'm done!"

CONSTRAINTS
- You must use "getNumLessThan.js" to generate your random number. Note: the "getNumLessThan.js" file is just an overly complicated way to make getting a random number asynchronous (there is no reason for it to be asynchronous, other than as an exercise).
- No editing any file except main.js (comments are the exception)
